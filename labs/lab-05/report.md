It is important to choose a license because it offers legal protection for your software. It is also important to inform users about how the software should be handled; for example, if you intend your software to be open source, a license plays a crucial role in ensuring that your software remains open source for all users.

Although there are many benefits of developing with a select team, I do agree that open source development allows for a piece of software to better cater to the user's needs. Open source development can allow for more developers to work on a project, significantly increasing the chance that a good idea is put forth. Additionally, the developers involved in open source development are oftentimes very invested in making a good product, which can positively impact the quality of the end result.

Linux is licensed under the GPL 2.0 license because the distributors intended Linux to be open source. Under the GPL 2.0 license, Linux users are allowed to do anything as long as they record any changes made to the codebase. These changes must also be free for other users as well.
